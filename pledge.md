# The Student Pledge

Yeah, that, be nice. That's it. That's the pledge. But case you were
wondering all of the following fall in the "be nice" category:

* Do help people out if they ask are stuck on something

* Do be on time, it sucks for everyone when you are late, really

* Do leave on time, it sucks for everyone when you don't, really

* Do be authentic, no need to lie

* Be respectful

* Take responsibility for your own actions and learning and
  attendance, your mom and dad aren't here. Speak for yourself. Send
  your own email questions. Learn to be independent. It's the nice
  thing to do.

And here are some things that can get you a [strike](policies.md):

* Don't touch someone else's computer, ever, even if you think it will
  be funny

* Don't touch other people in class, ever, even if you think it will
  be funny

* Don't bully, don't even joke around about bullying, even if you
  think it will be funny

* Don't disrespect others, even subtly including your friends,
  parents, other students, and your instructor

* Don't criticize, period. When someone asks for your opinion be nice
  and be honest.

* Don't use inappropriate language, jokes, or references. Keep
  everything rated G.

* Don't think that somehow you are the exception

There's a lot more that falls under "be nice" see if you can think of
others.

And girls? "Dude" is a non-gender-specific term, so yeah, you are
included.
