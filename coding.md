# What is Coding?

[![](/assets/coding.png)][code]

Coding is what happens when you write code. What's code?  Well,
this [Bloomberg article *What is Code?*][code] answers that best,
but the short answer is all the stuff you type to create stuff and
make other stuff happen, oh yeah, on the computer.

## Coding or Programming?

To be purely pedantic, *coding* is **not** *programming*, but
*programming* ***is*** *coding*. HTML, for example, is Hyper-Text
**Markup** Language. It's code, but its not programming. It's like
a PDF document, it's code to show how something should appear, but
their isn't really logic.  *JavaScript*, on the other hand, *is*
programming.  When in doubt, doesn't have an `if` statement it's
probably not programming. We prefer the term coding because a lot
of coding is creating the framework and content for how stuff should
appearâ€”especially web development.
