# Communications

Learning how to communicate while you are here is very important
to avoid misunderstanding, so let's go over the methods of communication
we use.

## Urgent, Immediate: Use the Phone of Text

Your location has a phone number that will always allow you or your
parents to immediately and directly communicate with the that
location's manager, who lives on or around that location. Use this
method for emergencies, notifications of being late, etc. We will
do our best to answer every text of phone message immediately. Take a
moment to write down your locations phone number if you don't already
have it:

**The phone number for my location is ______________**

## Announcements and Info: Use Site and Slack #news

If you want to see if we are open over a particular holiday you might
just check your locations web site. 

**The web site for my location is ______________**

## Help and Ideas: Slack

If you have a question about a level in CodeCombat or any course
material Slack is the place to be. Dozens of other students are there
to help you as well as staff. You should get into the habit of
checking the Slack room at least once a week:

**The Slack room for my location is ______________**

This is also where students collaborate with each other
and instructors to get extra projects done.

The #news channel will only be for news. #random is for #random fun
within reason. #parents is specifically for parent to find carpools
etc.

Our Slack room for every location is invite-only so you will have to
have your instructor, assistant, or location manager send you an
invite.

## Enrollment and Makeups: Use Email

Email will always be the primary method of registration for any
SkilStak location and is processed by the location manager combined
with PayPal invoicing. You, as a student, might not care about that,
but your parents will. Having an email history has proven the most
personable and least error prone approach.

**The main email for my location is ______________**

## Consultation: Email and Drop In

Sometimes speaking in person is the right thing to do. When that is
the case please send an email setting up a time and the location
manager will be happy to meet with you as soon as can be scheduled.
Usually this will not be during the break between classes due to the
amount of activity requiring the manager's attention during that time.

**The street address for my location is ______________**

## Pro Communications

Even though it is a way off, it is worth mentioning that when you
are a Pro student you will be expected to communicate for yourself.
It's good to get into that habit as soon as possible, instead of
relying on others to do it for you.
